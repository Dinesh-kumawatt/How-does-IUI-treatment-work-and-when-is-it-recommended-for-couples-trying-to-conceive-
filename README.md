Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment that is less invasive and more affordable than IVF. The process involves directly placing washed and concentrated sperm into the woman’s uterus during her ovulation period. This shortens the sperm’s journey, increasing the chances of fertilization. IUI is recommended for couples dealing with issues such as low sperm motility, mild male factor infertility, cervical mucus problems, or unexplained infertility. It is also suitable when the female partner has normal ovulation cycles but natural conception is not happening. The treatment is relatively simple, painless, and requires minimal medication compared to IVF. However, the success rate depends on factors such as the woman’s age, quality of sperm, and underlying medical conditions. Couples often try IUI as the first step in fertility care before moving to advanced options like IVF if needed. With proper medical guidance, IUI can offer a safe and effective pathway toward conception. For more details, visit: https://trinityivfahmedabad.com/iui-treatment/
